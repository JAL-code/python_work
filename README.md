# python_work
Building all chapters from Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes.  
Also, this repository develops GitHub skills.

All histories of each file will be:

1. Tracked as one file.

2. Frequently updated for each working version.

3. Code diverging from course will be added to a new branch.

4. These files work with Sublime, MU or VS Code.

5. A BASH version will be created later.

6. Windows 10 environment
    - GitHub Desktop: pull/push files with commits
    - Atom: control folder layout
    - Visio Studio Code: test files.

7. Linux Mint environment
    - Terminal: pull/push files with commits
    - MU or Nano: test files.
    - Sublime: test files.  Requires activation, hence use MU, which is free.
