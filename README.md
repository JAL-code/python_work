# python_work
Building all coursework from Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes.  Also, this repository develops GitHub skills.

All historys of each file will be:

1. Tracked as one file.
2. Frequently updated for each working version.
3. Code diverging from course will be added to a new branch.
4. These files work with Sublime, MU or VS Code.  A BASH version will be created later.
